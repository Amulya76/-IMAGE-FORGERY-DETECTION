🖼️ Image Forgery (Morphing) Detection using CNN
📌 Overview
This project implements an Image Forgery Detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as authentic (non-morphed) or tampered (morphed/forged). The model outputs percentage-based confidence scores indicating how much an image is real or manipulated and provides a GUI for real-time testing.

📂 Dataset
Dataset Used: CASIA 2.0
In this project I have taken dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divg07/casia-20-image-tampering-detection-dataset
Classes:
Au/ – Authentic (original) images
Tp/ – Tampered (forged/morphed) images
Non-image and corrupted files are automatically skipped.
